# BMS –Hospital Bed ManagementSystem

Context –Business and Social
The Inpatient Department or IPD is a unit of hospitals where patients get admitted for their medical 
conditions that require night stay with round-the-clock health monitoring. Assets management, especially 
bed management, is a key and frequently performed operation by the hospital administration team. Bed 
management is constant monitoring of admissions, discharges, and patient flow across departments so 
that administrators can keep a track of the availability of beds and can offer bed/room to a patient who 
needs immediate medical attention.
 
In a manual healthcare setup, the decentralized bed management system does not provide an overview 
of the bed availability in different wards (and ICU with different equipment) driving bed visibility and 
allocation a complex and lengthy process. Ideally, in a big hospital with a huge flow of patients, the 
administrators should be able to track and manage bed allocation and status through a unified intelligent 
dashboard. Dashboards support the doctors, medical practitioners, clinicians and hospital staffs to view 
reports, bed availability, bed type, ward/ICU type, bed size, allocation and discharge, thus streamlining the 
bed management process. 

• Create DDL from the ERD provided

• Write queries for all the relevant KPIs needed for creating a dashboard

• Insert data to demonstrate the query results.

• (Additional) Create the webpage to show the relevant queries in action
